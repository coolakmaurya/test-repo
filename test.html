Hi i am  transmission noc engineer.
we have 5.5 year of worked experience.
we have mostly worked experience in DWDM and OTN.
we need learn some one more tpoics in otn and dwdm.
dwdm technolgy based on mux and dux concept.
total internal reflection concept used in dwdm.
in dedm two type amplification concet like that 
1- EDFA amplification, 2- RAMAN amplificatio 
some basic diffirence b/w in EDFA and RAMAN amplifire
low noise in EDFA amplifire in comparision with RAMAN amplifire
RAMAN amplifire have higher gain in comparision with EDFA amplifire 
this is good technology for deta transmission
due to this technology deta easy transmit from one location to another location without any losses.
