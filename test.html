Hi we are transmission noc engineer.
we have 5.5 years of works experience.
we have mostly worked experience in DWDM and OTN.
we need learn some one more tpoics in otn and dwdm.
dwdm technolgy based on mux and dux concept.
total internal reflection concept used in dwdm.
in dedm two type amplification concept used like that - 
1- EDFA amplification, 2- RAMAN amplification. 
some basic diffirence b/w in EDFA and RAMAN amplifire like that -
low noise in EDFA amplifire in comparision with RAMAN amplifire.
RAMAN amplifire have higher gain in comparision with EDFA amplifire. 
we have findout how updated message we will push to vs code editor.
this one is happy moment for me.
